Code book describing the variables

Script Variables

# Create training Raw DataFrame
train_df 

# Create Test Raw DataFrame
test_df 

##STEP 1 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set named train_test_df

#STEP 2 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement:
mean_train_test_df
standard_train_test_df
# Merge mean and standard deviation dataframes into a single one - 
mean_standard_train_test_df

#STEP 3 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:
string_activities_train_df (y_train.txt)
string_activities_test_df (y_test.txt)

# Create activity training raw DataFrame
activities_train_df

# Create activity test raw DataFrame
activities_test_df

# Merge both activity training and activity test DataFrames
activities_train_test_df

# Replace Activity index with Activity Names for the activity training test DataFrame
1 ("WALKING")
2 ("WALKING_UPSTAIRS")
3 ("WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS")
4 ("SITTING")
5 ("STANDING")
6 ("LAYING")

#Subject for training ans test DataFrames
subject_train_test_df (subject_train.txt merged with subject_test.txt)

# Merge Activities and Subject Name DataFrame into main dataset from Step # 2
mean_standard_train_test_activities_subject_df

#STEP 4 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
